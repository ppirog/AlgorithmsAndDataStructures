The algorithms were written as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures class at UMCS. 

All of those provided had to pass tests by an algorithm checker. 

Algorithmic problems solved required implementing solutions from areas such as: 

- sorting, 
- lists,
- trees,
- graphs,
- stack,
- queues,
- divide and conquer,
- greedy algorithms,
- dynamic programming,
- backtracking
